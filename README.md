# MailAutomation-NodeJs
A Node.js based application that automatically sends an auto-reply to unread emails in your Gmail "INBOX" using the Gmail API in your absence. The application runs as a server and in the innterval of 45-120 seconds it checks for unread messages in the user's inbox. If an unread message is found, then it sends an auto-reply and modify it's label to "AutoReplied".

If you want to run this application in your local system then you have to create your own "credentials.JSON" file.
